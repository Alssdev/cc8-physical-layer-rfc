Welcome to **Physical Layer RFC**! This guide will help you set up the project locally and walk you through the basic steps to get started.

## 📋 Prerequisites
Before you begin, follow [this guide](https://piers.rocks/2023/09/05/installing-pico-sdk-and-picotool.html) to get some dependencies. After completing the steps, you should have installed:
- cmake
- make
- pico SDK
- picotool

<Callout variant="info">
  You can also use a **VSCode extension** to develop this project. If you prefer to use VSCode you can check
  the [Official Documentation](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/pico/getting-started-with-pico.pdf) of the **Pi Pico-series**.

<Callout variant="warning">
  Make sure you set up `PICO_SDK_PATH` in your environment variables; otherwise, you will need to set it each time you compile.
</Callout>

## 🛠️ Installation
Follow these steps to install and set up the project on your machine:

Clone your repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Alssdev/raspberry-pi-pico-spi-daisy-chain.git
cd raspberry-pi-pico-spi-daisy-chain
```

Open the file `~/Makefile` and modify the next line accoarding your board.
```makefile
# set pico board
PICO_BOARD=pico_w       # pico_w or pico
```

Compile the code:

```bash
make
```

Now your code is ready to be loaded into your board! 🎉

## 🚀 Flashing your board
To load the code you compiled into your board we include a handy make command.

Connect your board in `Flash mode`. Then run the following command:

```bash
make flash
```
Now all it's done! It's time to start coding! 🎉
